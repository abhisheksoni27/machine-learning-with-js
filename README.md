## Machine Learning with JavaScript :rocket:

You don't need ~~Python~~ to train your own models and perform Machine Learning.

This repository is linked to a series I have been writing about on Medium.com, regarding _ML in JS_. 

[Machine Learning with Javascript : Part 1](https://hackernoon.com/machine-learning-with-javascript-part-1-9b97f3ed4fe5)

## Repository Info

The repository is organized as follows:

1. **Linear Regression** | [linear-regression](https://github.com/abhisheksoni27/machine-learning-with-js/tree/master/linear-regression)
2. **k Nearest Neighbors** | [knn](https://github.com/abhisheksoni27/machine-learning-with-js/tree/master/knn)

## Get started

1. Clone this repo, or fork it and clone your own copy.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn` inside the repository to download the required `node_modules.`

That's it. 

Run the following command to run your model.

```bash
$ node index.js
```
Tweak certain things inside index.js and run again. Awesome, eh? :tada:
