## Machine Learning using JavaScript

You don't need ~~Python~~ to train your own models and perform Machine Learning.

This repository is linked to a series I have been writing about on Medium.com, regarding _ML in JS_. [Machine Learning with Javascript : Part 1](https://medium.com/@abhisheksoni2720/machine-learning-in-javascript-part-1)

## Repository Information

The repository is organized as follows:

1. **Linear Regression** has its own branch named `**linear-regression**`
2. The upcoming tutorials will follow the same strategy.

## Get started

1. Clone this repo, or fork it and clone your own copy.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn` inside the repository to download the required `node_modules.`

That's it. 

Run the following command to run your model.

```bash
$ node index.js
```
Tweak certain things inside index.js and run again. Awesome, eh? :tada:
